# The C++ Piano!
Some fun with the old Beep Function

**NOTE: THIS PROGRAM USES THE LEGACY BEEP FUNCTION. UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL NO LONGER WORK ON MODERN SYSTEMS.
	But if you have an older system with a timing chip for the PC Speaker, Have at it!**

This only plays, "Merrily We Roll Along" but it does work last time I checked.

I started this as just me playing around on the computer labs in college.

They ran Windows 10 but they were older systems and were still able to route the sound through the default audio device.
	
It's a fun little program but I see no point in developing it further due to the fact I can't actually tell if it works on my laptop...
and I'm not in range of a PC that could play it.

**Note 2: beepingPiano.VC.db is too big to add into the repository...Well then.**
